# Libraries Demo Use Examples

This repo illustrates some libraries in action that I've come across while coding on the Internet. All snippets are represented in the project that was written via Vite + ReactJS + TypeScript + TailwindCSS. This repo includes:

-   react-hook-form (+Zod)
-   SWR
-   TanStack Query (React Query)
-   GraphQL + Apollo React Client
